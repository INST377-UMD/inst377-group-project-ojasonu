                Music is shared between many cultures and languages. 
                While music as a whole is universally enjoyed, language is a barrier to a complete appreciation. 
                Listeners across the world explore other cultures by listening to 
                music yet fall short of the true expression of culture due to the language barrier. 
                Our goal is to allow people to enjoy music in as many languages as possible.

                We aimed to do this by allowing users to type in a song and then come up with a list of possible languages that the lyrics of that song could be translated into. 
                By selecting one of the languages in the dropdown, the lyrics of the song the user searched up would be translated into the selected language, allowing more people to understand the meaning behind that song.

                To differentiate songs with shared names, users can input the song name followed by the artist name.
                For example, "Jump" will return Jumpman by Drake and Future. "Jump Van Halen" will return the classic rock song. "Jump Kriss Kross" will return the song from the 90s.
